        Given a string, Check if characters of the given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
        For example characters of “geeksogeeks” can be rearranged to form a palindrome “geeksoskeeg”, but characters of “geeksforgeeks” cannot be rearranged to form a palindrome.

        Solution:
        A set of characters can form a palindrome if at most one character occurs odd number of times and all characters occur even number of times.
